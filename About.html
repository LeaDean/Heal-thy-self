            <h2>My Path to This Work</h2>
            <p>
                Like so many of us, I spent years moving through life with a quiet ache — a sense that something essential was missing or out of alignment. Stress lived in my body, old patterns looped in my mind, and joy felt distant even when everything looked "fine" on the outside.
            </p>
            <p>
                My turning point came when I finally stopped pushing and started listening — to breath, to sensation, to the subtle currents of energy that run beneath thoughts and stories. What began as personal curiosity blossomed into deep study: energy healing modalities, breathwork, somatic awareness, intuitive guidance, and the sacred art of holding space.
            </p>
            <p>
                Through my own unraveling and re-weaving, I discovered that true wholeness isn't something we chase — it's already here, waiting to be met with kindness and presence. Today I feel deeply honored to walk alongside others as they rediscover that same truth within themselves.
            </p>

            <h2>My Guiding Belief</h2>
            <p>
                We are not broken. We are layered — carrying imprints, protections, and beautiful forgotten light. Healing happens when we create safe, compassionate space for whatever needs to be seen, felt, released, or reclaimed.
            </p>
            <p>
                My sessions blend energy work, breath practices, intuitive listening, and gentle somatic exploration. Nothing is forced; everything unfolds in its own timing. I hold the field so you can meet yourself — exactly as you are, right now.
            </p>
            <blockquote class="quote">
                “You do not have to be good.<br>
                You do not have to walk on your knees<br>
                for a hundred miles through the desert, repenting.<br>
                You only have to let the soft animal of your body<br>
                love what it loves.”<br>
                — Mary Oliver
